## About

Costasiella is a project aimed at rebuilding [OpenStudio](https://github.com/openstudioproject/openstudio) using more modern technologies with a wider userbase. At the moment the project is nowhere near feature parity. That being said, all major components are up and running. Work on the GraphQL API is progressing nicely, we can run background tasks, the auth workflow is nearing completion and considerable work has gone into the admin section of the frontend.
